The included executable was compiled on OSX
Yosemite with graphics disabled.

If you would like to build your own exectuable, you
may have to modify the paths in the makefile.

Running:

$./edge_deletion <'.tsp' problem file>

The following command will run the edge elimination
algorithm on one of the included datasets.

$./edge_deletion data/pr1002.tsp

NOTE: The tsp file must have edge weight type EUC_2D
